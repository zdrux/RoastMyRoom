OAuth setup with Supabase + Expo (Android)

1) Configure providers in Supabase
- Dashboard → Authentication → Providers.
- Enable Google (and others later). Add your OAuth Client ID and Client Secret here. You do NOT ship these in the app; Supabase stores them.
- Authorized redirect URL (for Android Expo):
  - `roastmyroom://auth-callback`  (matches `scheme` in app.config.ts)

2) App deep link plumbing
- `app.config.ts` already sets `scheme: 'roastmyroom'`.
- Android intent filters are generated by Expo; no extra native code required.
- Route `app/auth-callback.tsx` completes the session then redirects to Profile.

3) Client code
- Use helpers in `lib/auth.ts`:
  - `signInWithGoogle()` will call `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google', options: { redirectTo } })` where `redirectTo` = `roastmyroom://auth-callback`.
  - `onAuthChange(cb)` lets you react to `SIGNED_IN`, etc.

4) Where to put secrets
- Put `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `docs/apikeys.txt` (already wired).
- Google OAuth Client ID/Secret are entered in the Supabase dashboard only.

5) Optional: move device user → auth user
- After sign-in, create/merge a `users` row for the authenticated user and migrate any local saved roasts to use their auth user id.
